# prediction_of_wine_quality
I sought to distinguish between wines of good and bad quality. Here are the steps of my approach:
1)Importing libraries, loading dataset(using pandas) and analysing it(using matplotlib, seaborn).
2)Selecting feature variable and target variable and splitting the data(using scikit learn) into train and test data.
3)Using different Machine Learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K neighbors classifier(KNN), Support vector machines(SVM), Gaussian naive bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, Xgboost to train and test the data.
4)Evaluating the accuracy score of test data for each ML algorithm and selecting the one with the highest score.
